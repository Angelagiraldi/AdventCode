Here a description of the challenges:

###--Day 1: Trebuchet?! --
The task at hand is to *decipher a calibration document* provided by the Elves, where each line of text contains specific calibration values. The goal is to extract these values by taking the first digit and the last digit of each line and combining them to form a two-digit number. For instance, from the line "1abc2," the calibration value would be 12 (using the first and last digits in that order). This process needs to be applied to all lines in the document, and the sum of all the extracted calibration values should be calculated and provided as the final answer.
