Here the description of the challenges:

##--Day 1: Trebuchet?! --
####PART 1
The task at hand is to *decipher a calibration document* provided by the Elves, where each line of text contains specific calibration values. The goal is to extract these values by taking the first digit and the last digit of each line and combining them to form a two-digit number. For instance, from the line "1abc2," the calibration value would be 12 (using the first and last digits in that order). This process needs to be applied to all lines in the document, and the sum of all the extracted calibration values should be calculated and provided as the final answer.
####PART 2
The new task requires extracting the real first and last digits, which may be represented as spelled-out numbers ("one" to "nine"), from each line in the calibration document. The goal is to identify the actual numerical values represented by words and then combine the first and last digits (either numerical or spelled-out) of each line to form two-digit numbers. Finally, the task is to calculate the sum of all these extracted calibration values.

##--Day 2: Cube Conundrum  --
####PART 1

The task involves playing a game on Snow Island where an Elf presents a bag filled with red, green, and blue cubes. Throughout several games, the Elf reveals subsets of these cubes from the bag, and the objective is to determine which games would have been possible if the bag initially contained 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.
To accomplish this, the information provided includes game IDs along with subsets of cubes revealed in each game. By comparing the revealed subsets against the specified cube counts, the task is to identify games where no subset exceeds the given cube limits. The final step involves summing up the IDs of these possible games as the solution to the task.

####PART 2
The task is to determine, for each game played on Snow Island, the minimum number of cubes of each color that must have been in the bag to make the game possible. The Elf specifies that the fewest cubes of each color are needed to ensure the game's feasibility.
To achieve this, we're given the same set of example games. For instance, in Game 1, the minimum set of cubes consisted of 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. The key is to ascertain the minimum number of cubes for each color without which the game would have been impossible to play.
The calculation of this minimum set of cubes involves identifying the lowest count for each color within each game scenario. The power of a set of cubes is determined by multiplying the counts of red, green, and blue cubes together. The task requires computing these minimum sets for each game and calculating the sum of the powers derived from these sets across all the games to obtain the final solution.

##--Day 3: Gear Ratios  --
####PART 1
This challenge involves an encounter with an Elf at a gondola lift station. The gondolas are not functioning due to a missing engine part. The Elf, surprised by your arrival, explains that any number adjacent to a symbol (including diagonally adjacent numbers) within the engine schematic constitutes a "part number." Your task is to add up all these part numbers in the engine schematic to identify the missing part. However, periods (.) within the schematic do not count as symbols for this purpose.

####PART 2
Despite fixing the missing part, the gondola hasn't left the station due to an unresolved issue. The problem lies with certain symbols denoted as '*' in the engine schematic. A 'gear' is any '*' symbol that is adjacent to exactly two 'part numbers' (as defined previously). The gear ratio of a gear is the result of multiplying the two adjacent part numbers together.
The task requires finding and calculating the gear ratios of all gears present in the engine schematic. Each gear's ratio is obtained by multiplying the two adjacent part numbers connected to the gear. The goal is to sum up all the gear ratios to help identify the problematic gear that needs replacement in the engine.


##--- Day 4: Scratchcards ---

The gondola takes you up. Strangely, though, the ground doesn't seem to be coming with you; you're not climbing a mountain. As the circle of Snow Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and lurches into the station.

As you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much warmer than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite humid. Is this where the water source is?

The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.

"Oh! Hello!" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. "How may I be of service?" You ask about water sources.

"I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is Island Island, after all! I bet the gardener would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you borrow my boat and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these scratchcards as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won."

The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).

As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.

For example:

Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).

Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.
Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.
Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.

Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth in total?

####--- Part Two ---

Just as you're about to report your findings to the Elf, one of you realizes that the rules have actually been printed on the back of every card this whole time.

There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.

Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table.)

This time, the above example goes differently:

Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5.
Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5.
Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.
Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with 1 instance of card 1, 2 instances of card 2, 4 instances of card 3, 8 instances of card 4, 14 instances of card 5, and 1 instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have 30 scratchcards!

Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards are won. Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards do you end up with?

--- Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer ---

You take the boat and find the gardener right where you were told he would be: managing a giant "garden" that looks more to you like a farm.

"A water source? Island Island is the water source!" You point out that Snow Island isn't receiving any water.

"Oh, we had to stop the water because we ran out of sand to filter it with! Can't make snow with dirty water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get more sand soon; we only turned off the water a few days... weeks... oh no." His face sinks into a look of horrified realization.

"I've been so busy making sure everyone here has food that I completely forgot to check why we stopped getting more sand! There's a ferry leaving soon that is headed over in that direction - it's much faster than your boat. Could you please go check it out?"

You barely have time to agree to this request when he brings up another. "While you wait for the ferry, maybe you can help us with our food production problem. The latest Island Island Almanac just arrived and we're having trouble making sense of it."

The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each other.

For example:

>seeds: 79 14 55 13
seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48
soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15
fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4
water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70
light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13
temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69
humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4

The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds 79, 14, 55, and 13.

The rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. That is, the section that starts with seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the source) to a soil number (the destination). This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.

Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number one by one, the maps describe entire ranges of numbers that can be converted. Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, the source range start, and the range length.

Consider again the example seed-to-soil map:

50 98 2
52 50 48
The first line has a destination range start of 50, a source range start of 98, and a range length of 2. This line means that the source range starts at 98 and contains two values: 98 and 99. The destination range is the same length, but it starts at 50, so its two values are 50 and 51. With this information, you know that seed number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51.

The second line means that the source range starts at 50 and contains 48 values: 50, 51, ..., 96, 97. This corresponds to a destination range starting at 52 and also containing 48 values: 52, 53, ..., 98, 99. So, seed number 53 corresponds to soil number 55.

Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.

So, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks like this:

>seed  soil
0     0
1     1
...   ...
48    48
49    49
50    52
51    53
...   ...
96    98
97    99
98    50
99    51


With this map, you can look up the soil number required for each initial seed number:

Seed number 79 corresponds to soil number 81.
Seed number 14 corresponds to soil number 14.
Seed number 55 corresponds to soil number 57.
Seed number 13 corresponds to soil number 13.
The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds. To do this, you'll need to convert each seed number through other categories until you can find its corresponding location number. In this example, the corresponding types are:

Seed 79, soil 81, fertilizer 81, water 81, light 74, temperature 78, humidity 78, location 82.
Seed 14, soil 14, fertilizer 53, water 49, light 42, temperature 42, humidity 43, location 43.
Seed 55, soil 57, fertilizer 57, water 53, light 46, temperature 82, humidity 82, location 86.
Seed 13, soil 13, fertilizer 52, water 41, light 34, temperature 34, humidity 35, location 35.
So, the lowest location number in this example is 35.

What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?


--- Day 6: Wait For It ---

The ferry quickly brings you across Island Island. After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.

As you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry dock. "Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island!" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.

You manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.

As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.

The organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.

For example:

Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
This document describes three races:

The first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9 millimeters.
The second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40 millimeters.
The third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters.
Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

So, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:

Don't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race.
Hold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of 6 millimeters.
Hold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10 millimeters.
Hold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.
Hold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.
Hold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10 millimeters.
Hold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6 millimeters.
Hold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters.
Since the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.

In the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.

In the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.

To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).

Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?


--- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---

You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about ghosts a few minutes ago.

One of the camel's pouches is labeled "maps" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of network of labeled nodes.

It seems like you're meant to use the left/right instructions to navigate the network. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!

After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach ZZZ.

This format defines each node of the network individually. For example:

RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
Starting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with AAA and go right (R) by choosing the right element of AAA, CCC. Then, L means to choose the left element of CCC, ZZZ. By following the left/right instructions, you reach ZZZ in 2 steps.

Of course, you might not find ZZZ right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: RL really means RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL... and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes 6 steps to reach ZZZ:

LLR

AAA = (BBB, BBB)
BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
Starting at AAA, follow the left/right instructions. How many steps are required to reach ZZZ?
